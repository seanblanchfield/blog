title: O2 Ireland Overcharging Me for Data Roaming

I been roaming with my iPhone in France and Italy. O2 Ireland's data roaming charges are preposterous, but I knew that. The EU has already regulated the cost of voice charges (see Regulation (EC) No 717/2007, [Wikipedia entry here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_on_roaming_charges_within_the_European_Union)). Apparently they are currently considering something similar for data and SMS charges.

Last month, I was still a little blown away by the total roaming charge, did a few calculations, and discovered that I was being significantly overcharged.

This month, I noticed exactly the same thing, with exactly the same proportional overcharge. Last month they just credited me back the money. This month, they've lodged it as a technical issue, and told me that I'll be credited back during the next few days, when the issue is dealt with by the tech team.

## Cost Breakdown

The data roaming charges for O2 Ireland are €4.95 inc. VAT per megabyte (309 times more expensive than their local data rate of 1.6c/MB, even though data roaming represents no additional infrastructural cost to them).

Anyway, that's €4.09 ex. VAT. On my last two bills they charged €8.50 ex VAT per MB. That's €10.26 inc. VAT per MB, more than twice their advertised rate.

For me, that represented an overcharge of €103 last month, and €134 this month.

I wonder if this is just me, or are they doing it to lots of people? I guess you'd need something like an iPhone to rack up enough data to really care.

## September Update

My friend, who is also being overcharged in exactly the same way, just pointed out to me that €10.26 is very close to €10.24, which is what a roaming megabyte would cost you if you didn't have a data plan (at 1 cent per kilobyte). So, it looks to me like I'm about to be overcharged again for the 3rd month in a row - I'll be calling O2 again tomorrow.

At least I know its not just me that's being overcharged now anyway.
