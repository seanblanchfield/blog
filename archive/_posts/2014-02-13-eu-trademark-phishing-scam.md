We recently filed a trademark application for our company, [PageFair](http://pagefair.com). This morning I received (by snail mail) this official-looking invoice from the "European Patent and Trademark Register" for extra filing fees. It turns out it's a complete scam. A Polish company appears to be monitoring for new trademark applications and attempting to phish a thousand Euro from each applicant.

**UPDATE:** See below for a second similar scam letter we received.

The small print says it all:

> "Please notice, that this form is not an invoice. This is an offer for the annual registration of your Trademark in our Internet database."

Better luck next time, losers.

![This scam letter is apparently from Poland, attempting to trick €1000 out of companies. The actual promise is only that the trademark will be listed on their special database.](/images/2014/02/trademark-scam.jpg){: .captioned }

![This one is apparently based in the US. A simple attempt to trick €2000 out of unwary companies.](/images/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-03-03-at-10.54.32.png){: .captioned }
