I gave the keynote speech at the [Python Ireland](http://python.ie/) Conference on October 14th 2012. I proposed that Dublin is one of the world's best emerging startup hubs, uniquely situated as the gateway between Europe and America. As programmers, we enjoy a blend of productivity, low costs and global reach previously inaccessible in any profession. In both geography and history, we are privileged in our ability to make a dent in the universe. Irish programmers should be founding startups, and I shared some tips for those who want to get started.
