I gave a talk on intellectual property at [TEDx at Goodenough College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka_EJYpWLh0) in London in February 2013. I focused on patents, how they have fallen out of step with the modern pace of innovation, and as a result are now causing more problems for innovation than they solve. I'd love to hear your responses!

> Thanks for that – it’s perhaps a simpler and more elegant solution. One challenge would be setting an appropriate R&D threshold. A startup might legitimately invent something on a budget of $20K. However, a firm such as Intellectual Ventures would have no difficulty budgeting $20K if it gave them license to troll.

> It may also be easy to evade: Here in Ireland there are significant tax breaks for multinational companies who perform R&D activities. It’s a well known joke how heavily abused this is, with major international firms somehow managing to classify a wide range of regular business activities as R&D.
