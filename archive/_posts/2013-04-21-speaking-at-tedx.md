I gave a talk on intellectual property at [TEDx at Goodenough College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka_EJYpWLh0) in London in February 2013. I focused on patents, how they have fallen out of step with the modern pace of innovation, and as a result are now causing more problems for innovation than they solve. I'd love to hear your responses!
