This week, I'm joining a group of representatives from the Irish games industry in a meeting with government policy advisors, to help establish whether or not games development should qualify for the R&D tax credit. There are many aspects to game development, and everyone has their own perspective, but I thought I'd try to clarify my own thoughts here.

## Current Situation

A significant tax credit is available in Ireland for research and development work done in companies. R&D is performed by high value workers, and leads to the generation not only of intellectual property, but of intellectual capital. This helps address the issue of footloose multinationals, and also helps build up the country's high-tech workforce, making Ireland yet more attractive to new foreign companies, as well as fostering the creation of new indigenous high-tech companies.

Strangely, although software development is considered generally eligible for this tax credit, there's some confusion whether the same is true for games development. I have no idea where this originated from. Perhaps the fact that video games are generally bought on DVDs and experienced on the TV resulted in someone lumping them into a bracket with film production. Of course, this is wrong. Perhaps more than any other field of software development, games development pushes the cutting edge of technology.

## It is intrinsically R&D

Games development is a kind of software development, and all software development is a process of continuous invention, experimentation and learning. Nowhere in software development is this more true than in games, where technological possibilities are constantly pushed to the limit.

I have experience with university research. I was education officer in Trinity College, and was a member of the college board, the university council and pretty much every other academic committee going. I was a graduate student in the computer science department, and was the graduate student representative for the school of computer science. Since that time I have been involved with diverse software companies, and I can categorically say that what goes on in them is basically the same as in university, only ten times faster and with commercial success (not one's publication record) as the goal.

I often find myself struggling to communicate aspects of software development to people. It is a highly abstract and revolutionary field, and it's no wonder that non-developers have difficulty understanding what we're doing. Some people clearly think that software development is about typing things very quickly into computers. Luckily, most people understand that it's a difficult field, but neither expect nor want to know any more about it than that. It could be because of this that games development has been lumped into the same category as film development and denied its tax credit.

So I want to try a rather simplified analogy to clear this up. Say a helicopter is being designed by some boffins, whose work culminates in a detailed set of blueprints for its construction. Production then commences, with actual helicopters being constructed based on the blueprints. Here we think of the work of the boffins with their blueprints as the R&D bit. The actual production wouldn't qualify. **In software development all we do is invent these blueprints**. The blueprints are equivalent to the computer code. No two blueprints are alike, none of them works the first time, every one of them takes inspiration and extreme mental effort to create. Now, the field of software has the special property that actually creating a product from the blueprint can be done at zero cost and zero effort. All you need to do is run the program.

Basically, all software development should be considered R&D. If there's a software developer developing software, then (s)he's doing R&D.

## A multidisciplinary holistic enterprise

It is possible that it is not the programming end of game development, but its accompanying disciplines that have cast doubt over its eligibility for R&D. Game development involves a mix of hardcore software development, games design, 2D and 3D art, scriptwriting, play testing and adaptation work to different hardware platforms and locales. Standing alone, some of these elements would be categorised in the humanities, not the sciences. However, game development is a holistic enterprise, in which all of these elements are tightly woven and inseparable. The process is iterative, and involves people of all disciplines rapidly responding to the work of everyone else. The game programmers strive to do justice to the 3D artwork, while the artists innovate in response to new abilities of the game programming. No single element can be extracted from the rest and make sense as a standalone activity. The goal is to create a game that harmoniously combines technology and design to produce an experience superior to what came before.

This is not unique to game development. Consider Apple's achievements with the iPhone. The iPhone represents a pinnacle of technology combined with excellent industrial design and user interface design, honed through testing. It's absurd to think that Ireland would refuse the iPhone team R&D status because they had so many designers and testers on staff. Without its design and testing, the iPhone would have been a poor competitor to the N95, and Nokia would still be a company you would invest in.

To a game studio, every game is the next iPhone. They are on the cutting edge, marrying design and new technology together in new ways, aiming to create a revolutionary experience.

## No detailed records

One requirement of receiving the R&D tax credit is that the company be able to furnish up on request detailed records of the research being performed. Although the intention is that these records should align closely with what is already being kept, this is far from the truth (at least for software development).

There are detailed requirements that records be kept describing each hypothesis advanced, each experiment performed to advance the hypothesis, various dated documentary evidence of each piece of work, what it was for, how it was carried out, how conclusions were drawn, what conclusions were drawn... and lots more.

Perhaps these kinds of records are routinely kept in the pharmaceutical research companies. I can say for sure that they are not kept in software companies. Over the last 10 years, commercial software development has embraced [Agile methodologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). A result of this is that the focus is now on rapid development iterations and customer feedback, a move away from large amounts of preliminary and ongoing documentation. In general, software companies will keep as little documentation as possible. Perhaps they can get away with it because the software code and its various user interfaces are an effective substitute. Whatever it is, the documentation requirements for the R&D credit cannot be met by a modern software development company.

## Summary

Although I feel that every software company I have encountered logically qualifies as R&D, as games companies they may not officially qualify. If they did qualify, the record keeping requirements would be impractical for them to comply with.

As someone who just wants to get on with company building, I need it to be simple. I'd like to get the tax credit on the basis that we do software development, and software development is intrinsically R&D. With that resolved, I don't see why I should need to provide any records other than to show how much was spent on software developers developing software in my company.
