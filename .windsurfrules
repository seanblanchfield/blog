# Project layout
- This is a blog implemented in Jekyll
- It is run locally via Docker
- the `./jekyll` script provides a wrapper for the Jekyll commands in Docker, as well as a deploy command that deploys the rendered blog to Cloudflare Pages.
- The `./current/_posts` directory contains the source markdown files for the blog posts. (`./archive/_posts` contains old blog posts).
- Blog posts contain frontmatter containing author,
date (is ISO 3166-1 format), `layout: post`, link, slug, title, image and draft (optional, boolean)
- a `<!-- more -->` tag is used to split the post summary for display on the home page.

# Content
- If asked to start a blog post, create the file in the `./current/_posts` directory, and name it `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.  Don't automatically add content.
- Run the `./jekyll serve` command to serve locally, and view the result in your browser at http://localhost:4000.
- If asked to write content, it should be in markdown format.
- Write a document plan before writing the content, and ask me for feedback on it before writing the content.
- When asked to write the content, work through the plan point by point. Leave the plan in place at the top of the document, and mark off each parts of the plan as "[DONE}" when you have completed it. 
- When you get to the end of the plan, review all the work you have done, and consider improvements to it, especially focusing on areas that seem redundant. Then propose a plan to improve the content, and ask for confirmation.
- If providing sources, search the web to find them and make sure the links are valid. You should transpose URLs you want to check into the following form: https://s.jina.ai/YOUR_URL which will return the content in markdown.
