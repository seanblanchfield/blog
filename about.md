I am a technologist and entrepreneur from Dublin, Ireland.Â  My most recent company was *PageFair*, where I was CEO and co-founder, helping web publishers stop revenue loss due to adblocking. *PageFair* was acquired by *Blockthrough* in late 2018. Prior to *PageFair*, I was best known as as the technical cofounder of *Demonware*, which pioneered online technology for the world's leading video games, including *Call of Duty* and *Guitar Hero*, and which was acquired by the largest video games company in the world in 2007. I also founded and co-organize *Techpreneurs*, an invite-only monthly meetup for Irish technology founders. 

I am currently running the Irish national startup accelerator programme at *Dogpatch Labs*. Through my company [Nuium](https://nuium.com) I take on consulting projects here and there, develop some open source and voluntary projects, and spend quite a bit of time on IoT R&D. I have a plan to launch an IoT accelerator and lab, with a focus on B2B climate-tech and agri-tech.

I've been starting companies since I was 19, beginning with a web 1.0 consultancy in the mid 90s, and graduating through [Phorest](http://phorest.com) (initially specializing in early mobile messaging in 2000) to [DemonWare](http://www.demonware.net), which I co-founded with [Dylan Collins](http://dylancollins.com) in 2003.


We specialized in online video gaming. I had an amazing time hiring geniuses, inventing new technology to solve hard problems, throwing wild parties on double-decker buses in LA, and getting to work with the best companies in the business on popular *Playstation* and *Xbox* games like *Guitar Hero* and *Call of Duty*.

*DemonWare* was acquired by [Activision Blizzard](http://www.activision.com) in 2007, and I remained on for a while as a VP. Demonware prospered as the core online technology platform of Activision, growing to hundreds of talented staff in Dublin, Vancouver, Montreal and Shanghai, and operating the most successful video game franchise of all time, [Call of Duty](http://www.callofduty.com/). This is a wonderful culmination of our original vision: we started with a lone conviction that multiplayer games like [Counter Strike](http://blog.counter-strike.net/) were going to go mainstream. This was borne out in *Counter Strike*'s spiritual descendant, *Call of Duty*, which not only runs on top of *DemonWare*, but is a multiplayer game first and a single player game second.

After *DemonWare* I found myself in the *Zynga* era of web-based social gaming, a continuation of the multiplayer arc, distilled down and gone mainstream. With [Brian McDonnell](https://twitter.com/mcdonnellb) I re-engineered and ran [Utopia](http://utopia-game.com), a massively multiplayer team-based web strategy game. I believe it to be oldest running game of its kind, with an extremely dedicated base of users, many of whom have been playing since the game's launch in the late 1990s. *Utopia* was acquired by [MUGA Gaming](http://www.mugagamingllc.com/) in 2017.

I was consulting CTO in *Jolt Online* in 2010, after its acquisition by *GameStop*, and I rapidly built a dev team, helped launch a few new games, and co-designed an interesting gamified sales campaign platform that was used by about 30 thousand staff. 

I 2011 I co-founded [Front Square](http://frontsquare.com) and built a multiplayer social game and gamified platform to taught the principles of *Lean Six Sigma* in enterprises. This scalably solved a very difficult education-delivery problem, but was killed by a long sales cycle.

In 2012 Brian McDonnell and I regrouped as *Scale Front*, a venture lab in which we tried to parallelize the Lean Startup method. We filtered 50 business ideas down to 5 product launches, and produced 2 businesses. One of these businesses, [PageFair](http://pagefair.com), soon became our core focus. 

We built *PageFair* into an internationally-recognised brand in digital media, researching the growth of adblocking, publishing widely-anticipated annual adblocking reports, placing the challenge of advertising sustainability on top of the online media industry's agenda, and working with hundreds of leading online newspapers, magazines and other websites to recover lost revenue through high-quality non-blockable ad technology. In November 2018, *PageFair* was acquired by *Blockthrough Inc*.
