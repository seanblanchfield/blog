I started a tech entrepreneur meetup 14 years ago, but not it's time to change it up. I'm writing this to get my reflections 
in order before we throw everything up in the air at the next meeting, and hopefully emerge with something new and better.

It was late 2011, and I was reeling from wasting a year in a startup that went nowhere. I had been "COO" (code for deputy CEO) and was probably insufferable, because I was pretty sure I should have been in charge. Having failed to find a CEO I could follow, I resolved to start learning whatever I needed so I could be an effective CEO of my next business. I invited some technical founder friends for drinks in the Lombard pub to talk about the business of startups from a technical perspective. "Techpreneurs" had begun.

I borrowed the initial format from Dr Simon Dobson's "Computer Science Reading Group", which I enjoyed as a PhD candidate in Trinity in the early 2000s. An putative topic sent to an short mailing list of faculty and students, with a date, time and name of one of Dublin's 700+  pubs. 

The second meeting includes some friends of friends who were also techies starting companies. From there on, the group grew organically. A member would suggest someone new, and I would normally arrange a coffee with them in advance, and go on to invite them to join if they were a technology company founder whoI would like to spend an evening talking to.

By 2013 we had over a hundred members, and typical 30% turn out to any individual event.
